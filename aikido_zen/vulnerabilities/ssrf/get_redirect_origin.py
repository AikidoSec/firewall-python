    This function checks if the given URL is part of a redirect chain that is passed in the redirects parameter.
    It returns the origin of a redirect chain if the URL is the result of a redirect.
    The origin is the first URL in the chain, so the initial URL that was requested and redirected
    to the given URL or, in the case of multiple redirects, the URL that was redirected to the given URL.

    Example:
    Redirect chain: A -> B -> C: get_redirect_origin([A -> B, B -> C], C) => A
                               : get_redirect_origin([A -> B, B -> C], B) => A
